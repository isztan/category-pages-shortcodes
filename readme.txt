Category Pages & Posts Shortcodes offers helpful shortcodes to display a post or page content, or a list of posts.
It also allow an exclusive relationship between a Category and a Page, in order to display the page content as "header" of category archives, with a simple php tag.

You can safely use shortcodes inside a post or a page, you can embed them in your templates or in your sidebar 
using the [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) WordPress function, like that:

`<?php do_shortcode('[showsingle <options>"]'); ?>`
